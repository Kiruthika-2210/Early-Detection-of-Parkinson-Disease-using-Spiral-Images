**EARLY DETECTION OF PARKINSON DISEASE USING SPIRAL IMAGES**

**Overview**

This project aims to detect early signs of Parkinson's Disease using hand-drawn (spiral and wave) images. Parkinson's disease affects motor functions, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze and classify spiral images based on known patterns associated with Parkinson's disease.
